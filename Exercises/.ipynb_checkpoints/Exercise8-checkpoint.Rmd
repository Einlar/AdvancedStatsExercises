# Exercise 1
- Students from the Bachelor degree in Physics performed an experiment to study the Zeeman effect. The apparatus contains a Ne source lamp whose position can be changed. During the setting up of the apparatus, the source position has to be adjusted in order to maximize the intensity of the detected light signal.
- The following table gives the position of the source (in mm) and the corresponding height of the peak (arbitrary units) for the wavelength under study:

# Exercise 1
- A researcher has collected $n=15$ observations that are supposed to come from a *Normal* distribution with known variance $\sigma^2 = 16$:

```{r}
data <- c(26.8, 26.3, 28.3, 28.5, 16.3,
          31.9, 28.5, 27.2, 20.9, 27.5,
          28.0, 18.6, 22.3, 25.0, 31.5)
```

- Assuming a normal prior for $\mu$,
